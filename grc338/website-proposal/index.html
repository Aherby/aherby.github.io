      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Tri Fins Surf </p>
      <p>Tri Fins Surf is a west coast surf gear and apparel store based in the San Luis Obispo, CA area. It gets its name from the 3 (or sometimes two) fins that are located on the bottom of a surfboard that help keep it stable. The small store focuses on cheap daily gear rentals and building its local brand through clothing. </p>
      <h2>Target audience</h2>
      <p>Anyone who surfs or wants to purchase clothing representing the surf culture in the San Luis Obispo area. The site will be designed to complement the fictional physical store. Surfing is an undeniably large part of the culture in San Luis Obispo and the locally owned surf shops are a major part of that community. The Surfers of the San Luis Obispo area are a tight knit group that build relationships with the places that they buy gear and often like to represent their favorite stores and brands when they aren't out riding waves. </p>
      <p>San Luis Obispo is located nearby several awesome surfing locations, and there are many across the central coast in general. Between the local Cal Poly students and general San Luis Obispo population there is a demand for surfing products for a variety of skill levels.
