        <h3>Jazz and Hip Hop: Connecting two of America's most original homegrown art forms</h3>
        <p>Article written by Blake Gillespie</p>
        <p>When the term “jazz rap” first entered into general use in the early ‘90s, it was meant to suggest a fusion moment for the two genres—the moment when rap producers started sampling jazz records and collaborating with jazz artists. But now, some 30 years later, the artists operating in that broad field express reticence over the “othering” that term suggests, instead embracing it as part of the continuum of Black American music. As jazz drummer and rapper/producer Kassa Overall puts it, both art forms come from the same people; it’s just a different moment in time. “You’re looking at a continuum that’s being stopped in time for the sake of defining itself,” Overall says.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the emergence of the term marked a watershed moment; generations of black musicians suddenly became artistic peers. Guru of Gang Starr released Jazzmatazz Vol.I, which featured collaborations with Donald Byrd, Lonnie Liston Smith, and Roy Ayers. Digable Planets won a Grammy for “Rebirth of Slick (I’m Cool Like That),” sampling Art Blakey and The Jazz Messengers’ “Stretching.” De La Soul collaborated with Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley, and Pee Wee Ellis on Buhloone Mindstate; and a UK group called Us3 earned legendary jazz label Blue Note Records its first gold single by looping Herbie Hancock’s “Cantaloupe Island” for “Cantaloop (Flip Fantasia).” Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, Freestyle Fellowship were turning their voices into instruments with expressive rap styles that mimicked soloing horns—capable of being either mathematically musical, or unbridled and free.</p>

          <figcaption>Jazz has long been a heralded form of self expression</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Jazz rap became somewhat démodé in the mid-to-late-‘90s with the mainstream dominance of G-funk and the “shiny suit era” of East Coast rap. But in recent years, it’s returned in vibrant form, something rapper and jazz trumpeter Leron Thomas—aka Pan Amsterdam—credits to the educational efforts of Wynton Marsalis. Marsalis played an instrumental role promoting jazz as a serious area of study to major universities, while he encouraged young musicians to play music by Duke Ellington and other greats. He would go on to teach at New York’s The New School alongside jazz legends like Gary Bartz, Reggie Workman, and Roy Hargrove.</p>
        <p>Thomas moved to New York from Houston in the late ‘90s, linking up with his high school classmate Robert Glasper and Bilal at The New School of Contemporary Jazz. That connection lead to his trumpet playing being featured on multiple albums by the Soulquarian collective, particularly Bilal’s shelved album Love For Sale.</p>

          <figcaption>One thing that links these two historic genres is their reliance on unique drum beats to provide a strong backing.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Melanie Charles, a jazz singer and flutist who’s equally skilled with a sampler, cites J Dilla’s early group Slum Village as particularly influential, while Kassa Overall gives credit to Madlib for the sound’s resurgence. “He’s somebody that, with what’s going on right now, someday people are going to bring him in and say, ‘Your throne is here’,” Overall says. “‘You’re the cat. What should we do next, boss?’” He also credits Erykah Badu as a pioneer, saying, “It sounded like R&B and jazz singing; but you heard the boom-bap from her.”</p>

          <figcaption>Sampling jazz music for hip hop songs is one major way that historic jazz performances can reach modern audiences in new ways.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>Now, the artists operating under the broad and imprecise subheading are seeking to not only acknowledge the music’s past, but push it into the future. For Charles, that desire manifests in her project “Make Jazz Trill Again,” which seeks to remind listeners where the music comes from, while also laying a path for where it’s going. “Back in the day, jazz music was popular music,” says Charles. “It was music that people were dancing to and twerking to, and drinking to, and partying to. Then, something happened where it became institutionalized and it became ‘sit-down’ music. The people who created this hip-hop jazz thing—I don’t know if they thought of it this way, but I feel like really it’s the gateway of bringing jazz back to the people.”</p>
        <p>Any attempt to box “jazz rap” into a single definition is ultimately futile. But the following selections offer a glimpse of the kind of records that might qualify; but make no mistake: no single grouping can ever be complete.</p>
